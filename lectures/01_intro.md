# Reproducible research: What and Why

## Day 1, Wed Jan 11:

1. Introductions. Each student states the phase of their project, their department, and their motivation for taking the class.
     * Class scheduling

2. Organize groups 
    1. Have the	students fill out experience questionnaire and add up points (on a 0-2 scale) 
        2. Have students line up by experience from most to least
        3. Divide into thirds, I guess. Each group of 3 must contain 1 student from each third.
        4. Go sit with your group. 

3. Talk a bit about my class goals.
     1. What does it take to make research reproducible?
        * Reinhart - Rogoff Excel sheet story

    2. Why R? 
        * widely-used
        * open-source
        * excellent statistical, plotting, and report-generating capabilities
        * designed for scientists, by scientists

    3. Why not R?
        * slow (but...)
        * designed for scientists, by scientists
        * there are good alternatives - especially Python

    4. What should you be able to do at the end of this class?
        * Import, process, and export results and plots in R.
        * Write simple functions - and hopefully packages - in R.
        * Know how to take a more systematic approach to data analysis, no matter what your platform. 

## Assignment: Due Friday, Jan 20
1. Read Millman and Perez. Make a 1-page (or less), bullet-pointed 'cheat sheet' of best practices for reproducible research. 
2. Read the story of Reinhart and Rogoff [http://www.economist.com/news/finance-and-economics/21576362-seminal-analysis-relationship-between-debt-and-growth-comes-under](Economist article) and [http://rooseveltforward.org/researchers-finally-replicated-reinhart-rogoff-and-there-are-serious-problems/](blog post by Mike Konczal)
3. Figure out what the 'chon_rates.xlsx' spreadsheet does. The group should write a brief outline or flow chart. Turn in one per group. DON'T SPEND MORE THAN A HALF HOUR ON THIS
